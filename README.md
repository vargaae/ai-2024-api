AI detection image analysis | AI visual inspection tool application with Clarifai API. This application analyses the loaded image and makes predictions of concepts, that we can use for example for keywords. I designed and developed the React application for this AI detection tool. It's connected to the server side through the Routes - REST API and through the encrypted auth services.
